Much food and water there/on way  Great interview on @foxandfriends with the parents of Otto Warmbier But while Dallas dropped to its knees as a team, they all stood up for our National Anthem. Big progress being made-we all love our country!  The booing at the NFL football game last night, when the entire Dallas team dropped to its knees, was loudest I have ever heard. Great anger  Ratings for NFL football are way down except before game starts, when people tune in to see whether or not our country will be disrespected!  A few of the many clips of John McCain talking about Repealing &amp; Replacing O'Care. My oh my has he changed-complete‚Ä¶  ...owed to Wall Street and the banks which, sadly, must be dealt with.

Tremendous backlash against the NFL and its players for disrespect of our Country.
29 General John Kelly totally agrees w/ my stance on NFL players and the fact that they should not be disrespecting our FLAG or GREAT COUNTRY!  .@CNN is #FakeNews. Just reported COS (John Kelly) was opposed to my stance on NFL players disrespecting FLAG, ANTHEM, COUNTRY. Total lie!  RT @jayMAGA45 #StandForOurAnthem  The White House never looked more beautiful than it did returning last night. Important meetings taking place today. Big tax cuts &amp; reform.  The issue of kneeling has nothing to do with race. It is about respect for our Country, Flag and National Anthem. NFL must respect this!  Many people booed the players who kneeled yesterday (which was a small percentage of total). These are fans who demand respect for our Flag!  So proud of NASCAR and its supporters and fans. They won't put up with disrespecting our Country or our Flag - they said it loud and clear!  Making America Safe is my number one priority. We will not admit those into our country we cannot safely vet.
 2017-09-24 23 Sports fans should never condone players that do not stand proud for their National Anthem or their Country. NFL should change policy!  Alaska, Arizona, Maine and Kentucky are big winners in the Healthcare proposal. 7 years of Repeal &amp; Replace and some Senators not there.

Great solidarity for our National Anthem and for our Country. Standing with locked arms is good, kneeling is not acceptable. Bad ratings!  ...NFL attendance and ratings are WAY DOWN. Boring games yes, but many stay away because they love our country. League should back U.S.  If NFL fans refuse to go to games until players stop disrespecting our Flag &amp; Country, you will see change take place fast. Fire or suspend!  Just heard Foreign Minister of North Korea speak at U.N. If he echoes thoughts of Little Rocket Man, they won't be around much longer!  Roger Goodell of NFL just put out a statement trying to justify the total disrespect certain players show to our country.Tell them to stand!  Democrats are laughingly saying that McCain had a "moment of courage." Tell that to the people of Arizona who were deceived. 116% increase!  Iran just test-fired a Ballistic Missile capable of reaching Israel.They are also working with North Korea.Not much of an agreement we have!  Very proud of our incredible First Lady (@FLOTUS.) She is a truly great representative for our country!  ...our Great American Flag (or Country) and should stand for the National Anthem. If not, YOU'RE FIRED. Find something else to do!  If a player wants the privilege of making millions of dollars in the NFL,or other leagues, he or she should not be allowed to disrespect....  Going to the White House is considered a great honor for a championship team.Stephen Curry is hesitating,therefore invitation is withdrawn!  It was great being with Luther Strange last night in Alabama. What great people, what a crowd! Vote Luther on Tuesday.  Alaska had a 200% plus increase in premiums under ObamaCare, worst in the country. Deductibles high, people angry! Lisa M comes through.  I know Rand Paul and I think he may find a way to get there for the good of the Party!  Large Block Grants to States is a good thing to do. Better control &amp;  management. Great for Arizona. McCain let his best friend L.G. down!  Arizona had a 116% increase in ObamaCare premiums last year, with deductibles very high. Chuck Schumer sold John McCain a bill of goods. Sad  John McCain never had any intention of voting for this Bill, which his Governor loves. He campaigned on Repeal &amp; Replace. Let Arizona down!  Heading to Alabama now, big crowd!

With only a very small majority, the Republicans in the House &amp; Senate need more victories next year since Dems totally obstruct, no votes!  As I have always said, let ObamaCare fail and then come together and do a great healthcare plan. Stay tuned!  We were let down by all of the Democrats and a few Republicans. Most Republicans were loyal, terrific &amp; worked really hard. We will return!  Republicans should just REPEAL failing ObamaCare now &amp; work on a new Healthcare Plan that will start from a clean slate. Dems will join in!  Most politicians would have gone to a meeting like the one Don jr attended in order to get info on an opponent. That's politics!  Heading back to Washington, D.C.

The real story is that President Obama did NOTHING after being informed in August about Russian meddling. With 4 months looking at Russia...  ...and did not want to "rock the boat." He didn't "choke," he colluded or obstructed, and it did the Dems and Crooked Hillary no good.  The reason that President Obama did NOTHING about Russia after being notified by the CIA of meddling is that he expected Clinton would win..  The Democrats have become nothing but OBSTRUCTIONISTS, they have no policies or ideas. All they do is delay and complain.They own ObamaCare!  Hillary Clinton colluded with the Democratic Party in order to beat Crazy Bernie Sanders. Is she allowed to so collude? Unfair to Bernie!  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!  I cannot imagine that these very fine Republican Senators would allow the American people to suffer a broken ObamaCare any longer!

Big meeting today with Republican leadership concerning Tax Cuts and Healthcare. We are all pushing hard - must get it right!  RT @foxandfriends RT @foxandfriends That's right, we need a TRAVEL BAN for certain DANGEROUS countries, not some politically correct term that won't help us protect our people!

In any event we are EXTREME VETTING people coming into the U.S. in order to help keep our country safe. The courts are slow and political!  The Justice Dept. should ask for an expedited hearing of the watered down Travel Ban before the Supreme Court - &amp; seek much tougher version!  The Justice Dept. should have stayed with the original Travel Ban, not the watered down, politically correct version they submitted to S.C.  People, the lawyers and the courts can call it whatever they want, but I am calling it what we need and what it is, a TRAVEL BAN!  Do you notice we are not having a gun debate right now? That's because they used knives and a truck!  At least 7 dead and 48 wounded in terror attack and Mayor of London says there is "no reason to be alarmed!"  We must stop being politically correct and get down to the business of security for our people. If we don't get smart it will only get worse  Whatever the United States can do to help out in London and the U. K., we will be there - WE ARE WITH YOU. GOD BLESS!  We need to be smart, vigilant and tough. We need the courts to give us back our rights. We need the Travel Ban as an extra level of safety!

I will be announcing my decision on Paris Accord, Thursday at 3 Crooked Hillary Clinton now blames everybody but herself, refuses to say she was a terrible candidate. Hits Facebook &amp; even Dems &amp; DNC.  It was an honor to welcome the Prime Minister of Vietnam, Nguy·ªÖn Xu√¢n Ph√∫c to the @WhiteHouse this afternoon.  We traveled the world to strengthen long-standing alliances, and to form new partnerships. See more at I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days.

Enjoy!  RT @foxandfriends RT @Scavino45 The U.S. Senate should switch to 51 votes, immediately, and get Healthcare and TAX CUTS approved, fast and easy. Dems would do it, no doubt!  Russian officials must be laughing at the U.S. &amp; how a lame excuse for why the Dems lost the election has taken over the Fake News.  We have a MASSIVE trade deficit with Germany, plus they pay FAR LESS than they should on NATO &amp; military. Very bad for U.S. This will change  I look forward to paying my respects to our brave men and women on this Memorial Day at Arlington National Cemetery later this morning.

I suggest that we add more dollars to Healthcare and make it the best anywhere. ObamaCare is dead - the Republicans will do much better!  British Prime Minister May was very angry that the info the U.K. gave to U.S. about Manchester was leaked. Gave me full details!  Does anyone notice how the Montana Congressional race was such a big deal to Dems &amp; Fake News until the Republican won?

In the meantime they continue to cover me inaccurately and with a nasty tone!  I cancelled today's meeting with the failing @nytimes when the terms and conditions of the meeting were changed at the last moment. Not nice  Many people would like to see @Nigel_Farage represent Great Britain as their Ambassador to the United States. He would do a great job!

I am not trying to get "top level security clearance" for my children. This was a typically false news story.  Very organized process taking place as I decide on Cabinet and many other positions. I am the only one who knows who the finalists are!  The Electoral College is actually genius in that it brings all states, including the smaller ones, into play. Campaigning is much different!  If the election were based on total popular vote I would have campaigned in  N.Y.

Thank you to Carmen Yulin Cruz, the Mayor of San Juan, for your kind words on FEMA etc.We are working hard. Much food and water there/on way  Great interview on @foxandfriends with the parents of Otto Warmbier But while Dallas dropped to its knees as a team, they all stood up for our National Anthem. Big progress being made-we all love our country!  The booing at the NFL football game last night, when the entire Dallas team dropped to its knees, was loudest I have ever heard. Great anger  Ratings for NFL football are way down except before game starts, when people tune in to see whether or not our country will be disrespected!  A few of the many clips of John McCain talking about Repealing &amp; Replacing O'Care. My oh my has he changed-complete‚Ä¶  ...owed to Wall Street and the banks which, sadly, must be dealt with. Food, water and medical are top priorities - and doing well. #FEMA  ...It's old electrical grid, which was in terrible shape, was devastated.

Texas &amp; Florida are doing great but Puerto Rico, which was already suffering from broken infrastructure &amp; massive debt, is in deep trouble..  Tremendous backlash against the NFL and its players for disrespect of our Country.
29 General John Kelly totally agrees w/ my stance on NFL players and the fact that they should not be disrespecting our FLAG or GREAT COUNTRY!  .@CNN is #FakeNews. Just reported COS (John Kelly) was opposed to my stance on NFL players disrespecting FLAG, ANTHEM, COUNTRY. Total lie!  RT @jayMAGA45 #StandForOurAnthem  The White House never looked more beautiful than it did returning last night. Important meetings taking place today. Big tax cuts &amp; reform.  The issue of kneeling has nothing to do with race. It is about respect for our Country, Flag and National Anthem. NFL must respect this!  Many people booed the players who kneeled yesterday (which was a small percentage of total). These are fans who demand respect for our Flag!  So proud of NASCAR and its supporters and fans. They won't put up with disrespecting our Country or our Flag - they said it loud and clear!  Making America Safe is my number one priority. We will not admit those into our country we cannot safely vet.
 2017-09-24 23 Sports fans should never condone players that do not stand proud for their National Anthem or their Country. NFL should change policy!  Alaska, Arizona, Maine and Kentucky are big winners in the Healthcare proposal. 7 years of Repeal &amp; Replace and some Senators not there.  Courageous Patriots have fought and died for our great American Flag --- we MUST honor and respect it!  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Great solidarity for our National Anthem and for our Country. Standing with locked arms is good, kneeling is not acceptable. Bad ratings!  ...NFL attendance and ratings are WAY DOWN. Boring games yes, but many stay away because they love our country. League should back U.S.  If NFL fans refuse to go to games until players stop disrespecting our Flag &amp; Country, you will see change take place fast. Fire or suspend!  Just heard Foreign Minister of North Korea speak at U.N. If he echoes thoughts of Little Rocket Man, they won't be around much longer!  Roger Goodell of NFL just put out a statement trying to justify the total disrespect certain players show to our country.Tell them to stand!  Democrats are laughingly saying that McCain had a "moment of courage." Tell that to the people of Arizona who were deceived. 116% increase!  Iran just test-fired a Ballistic Missile capable of reaching Israel.They are also working with North Korea.Not much of an agreement we have!  Very proud of our incredible First Lady (@FLOTUS.) She is a truly great representative for our country!  ...our Great American Flag (or Country) and should stand for the National Anthem. If not, YOU'RE FIRED. Find something else to do!  If a player wants the privilege of making millions of dollars in the NFL,or other leagues, he or she should not be allowed to disrespect....  Going to the White House is considered a great honor for a championship team.Stephen Curry is hesitating,therefore invitation is withdrawn!  It was great being with Luther Strange last night in Alabama. What great people, what a crowd! Vote Luther on Tuesday.  Alaska had a 200% plus increase in premiums under ObamaCare, worst in the country. Deductibles high, people angry! Lisa M comes through.  I know Rand Paul and I think he may find a way to get there for the good of the Party!  Large Block Grants to States is a good thing to do. Better control &amp;  management. Great for Arizona. McCain let his best friend L.G. down!  Arizona had a 116% increase in ObamaCare premiums last year, with deductibles very high. Chuck Schumer sold John McCain a bill of goods. Sad  John McCain never had any intention of voting for this Bill, which his Governor loves. He campaigned on Repeal &amp; Replace. Let Arizona down!  Heading to Alabama now, big crowd!  Thank you to Doug Parker and American Airlines for all of the help you have given to the U.S. with Hurricane flights. Fantastic job!  #USAatUNGAüá∫üá∏#UNGA  Will be in Alabama tonight. Luther Strange has gained mightily since my endorsement, but will be very close. He loves Alabama, and so do I!

I would not sign Graham-Cassidy if it did not include coverage of pre-existing conditions. It does! A great Bill. Repeal &amp; Replace.

//t.co/PrVceEmPOB  ObamaCare is dead and the Democrats are obstructionists, no ideas or votes, only obstruction. It is solely up to the 52 Republican Senators!  The Republican Senators must step up to the plate and, after 7 years, vote to Repeal and Replace. Next, Tax Reform and Infrastructure. WIN!  In all fairness to Anthony Scaramucci, he wanted to endorse me 1st, before the Republican Primaries started, but didn't think I was running!  My son Donald openly gave his e-mails to the media &amp; authorities whereas Crooked Hillary Clinton deleted (&amp; acid washed) her 33,000 e-mails!  ...What about all of the Clinton ties to Russia, including Podesta Company, Uranium deal, Russian Reset, big dollar speeches etc.  So many people are asking why isn't the A.G. or Special Council looking at the many Hillary Clinton or Comey crimes. 33,000 e-mails deleted?  While all agree the U. S. President has the complete power to pardon, why think of that when only crime so far is LEAKS against us.FAKE NEWS  This morning I will be going to the Commissioning Ceremony for the largest aircraft carrier in the world, The Gerald R.

 2017-07-20 02 The Republicans never discuss how good their healthcare bill is, &amp; it will get even better at lunchtime.The Dems scream death as OCare dies!  I will be having lunch at the White House today with Republican Senators concerning healthcare. They MUST keep their promise to America!  RT @FoxNews The Fake News is becoming more and more dishonest! Even a dinner arranged for top 20 leaders in Germany is made to look sinister!  Fake News story of secret dinner with Putin is "sick." All G 20 leaders, and spouses, were invited by the Chancellor of Germany. Press knew!  The Senate must go to a 51 vote majority instead of current 60 votes. Even parts of full Repeal need 60. 8 Dems control Senate. Crazy!  With only a very small majority, the Republicans in the House &amp; Senate need more victories next year since Dems totally obstruct, no votes!  As I have always said, let ObamaCare fail and then come together and do a great healthcare plan. Stay tuned!  We were let down by all of the Democrats and a few Republicans. Most Republicans were loyal, terrific &amp; worked really hard. We will return!  Republicans should just REPEAL failing ObamaCare now &amp; work on a new Healthcare Plan that will start from a clean slate. Dems will join in!  Most politicians would have gone to a meeting like the one Don jr attended in order to get info on an opponent. That's politics!  Heading back to Washington, D.C. Much will be accomplished this week on trade, the military and security!  Congratulations to Sung Hyun Park on winning the 2017 @USGA #USWomensOpenüá∫üá∏  I am at the @USGA  #USWomensOpen.

Thank you to former campaign adviser Michael Caputo for saying so powerfully that there was no Russian collusion in our winning campaign.  Thank you to all of the supporters, who far out-numbered the protesters, yesterday at the Women's U.S. Open. Very cool!  HillaryClinton can illegally get the questions to the Debate &amp; delete 33,000 emails but my son Don is being scorned by the Fake News Media?

The W.H. is functioning perfectly, focused on HealthCare, Tax Cuts/Reform &amp; many other things. I have very little time for watching T.V.  Why aren't the same standards placed on the Democrats. Look what Hillary Clinton may have gotten away with. Disgraceful!  .@WashTimes states "Democrats have willfully used Moscow disinformation to influence the presidential election against Donald Trump."  ISIS is on the run &amp; will soon be wiped out of Syria &amp; Iraq, illegal border crossings are way down (75%) &amp; MS 13 gangs are being removed.  RT @foxandfriends Remember, when you hear the words "sources say" from the Fake Media, often times those sources are made up and do not exist.  My son Donald did a good job last night.

When I left Conference Room for short meetings with Japan and other countries, I asked Ivanka to hold seat. Very standard. Angela M agrees!  I cannot imagine that Congress would dare to leave Washington without a beautiful new HealthCare bill fully approved and ready to go!  James Comey leaked CLASSIFIED INFORMATION to the media. That is so illegal!  RT @foxandfriends RT @foxandfriends RT @RealJamesWoods The fact that President Putin and I discussed a Cyber Security unit  doesn't mean I think it can happen. It can't-but a ceasefire can,&amp; did!  Syrian ceasefire seems to be holding. Many lives can be saved. Came out of meeting. Good!  For years, even as a "civilian," I listened as Republicans pushed the Repeal and Replace of ObamaCare. Now they finally have their chance!  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!  Sanctions were not discussed at my meeting with President Putin. Nothing will be done until the Ukrainian &amp; Syrian problems are solved!  ...have it. Fake News said 17 intel agencies when actually 4 (had to apologize). Why did Obama do NOTHING when he had info before election?  ...and safe. Questions were asked about why the CIA &amp; FBI had to ask the DNC 13 times for their SERVER, and were rejected, still don't....  Putin &amp; I discussed forming an impenetrable Cyber Security unit    so that election hacking, &amp; many other negative things, will be guarded..  ...We negotiated a ceasefire in parts of Syria which will save lives.

I just finished a great meeting with the Republican Senators concerning HealthCare. They really want to get it right, unlike OCare!  With ZERO Democrats to help, and a failed, expensive and dangerous ObamaCare as the Dems legacy, the Republican Senators are working hard!  So they caught Fake News CNN cold, but what about NBC, CBS &amp; ABC? What about the failing @nytimes &amp; @washingtonpost? They are all Fake News!

Perhaps just let OCare crash &amp; burn!  ..under a magnifying glass, they have zero "tapes" of T people colluding. There is no collusion &amp; no obstruction. I should be given apology!  The real story is that President Obama did NOTHING after being informed in August about Russian meddling. With 4 months looking at Russia...  ...and did not want to "rock the boat." He didn't "choke," he colluded or obstructed, and it did the Dems and Crooked Hillary no good.  The reason that President Obama did NOTHING about Russia after being notified by the CIA of meddling is that he expected Clinton would win..  The Democrats have become nothing but OBSTRUCTIONISTS, they have no policies or ideas. All they do is delay and complain.They own ObamaCare!  Hillary Clinton colluded with the Democratic Party in order to beat Crazy Bernie Sanders. Is she allowed to so collude? Unfair to Bernie!  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!  I cannot imagine that these very fine Republican Senators would allow the American people to suffer a broken ObamaCare any longer!  Obama Administration official said they "choked" when it came to acting on Russian meddling of election. They didn't want to hurt Hillary?

That would be very bad for the Republican Party - and please let Cryin' Chuck stay!  ...Why did the DNC REFUSE to turn over its Server to the FBI, and still hasn't? It's all a big Dem scam and excuse for losing the election!  ...Why did Democratic National Committee turn down the DHS offer to protect against hacks (long prior to election). It's all a big Dem HOAX!  By the way, if Russia was working so hard on the 2016 Election, it all took place during the Obama Admin. Why didn't they stop them?

The Justice Dept. should have stayed with the original Travel Ban, not the watered down, politically correct version they submitted to S.C.  People, the lawyers and the courts can call it whatever they want, but I am calling it what we need and what it is, a TRAVEL BAN!  Do you notice we are not having a gun debate right now? That's because they used knives and a truck!  At least 7 dead and 48 wounded in terror attack and Mayor of London says there is "no reason to be alarmed!"

I suggest that we add more dollars to Healthcare and make it the best anywhere. ObamaCare is dead - the Republicans will do much better!

Incredible men &amp; women who protect &amp; serv‚Ä¶  I don't know Putin, have no deals in Russia, and the haters are going crazy - yet Obama can make a deal with Iran, #1 in terror, no problem!  The threat from radical Islamic terrorism is very real, just look at what is happening in Europe and the Middle-East. Courts must act fast!  The failing @nytimes was forced to apologize to its subscribers for the poor reporting it did on my election win. Now they are worse!  An extended interview from the Super Bowl with @oreillyfactor airs tonight at 8 The failing @nytimes writes total fiction concerning me. They have gotten it wrong for two years, and now are making up stories &amp; sources!  I call my own shots, largely based on an accumulation of data, and everyone knows it. Some FAKE NEWS media, in order to marginalize, lies!  Any negative polls are fake news, just like the CNN, ABC, NBC polls in the election. Sorry, people want border security and extreme vetting.  What an amazing comeback and win by the Patriots. Tom Brady, Bob Kraft and Coach B are total winners. Wow!  Enjoy the #SuperBowl and then we continue I have instructed Homeland Security to check people coming into our country VERY CAREFULLY. The courts are making the job very difficult!  Just cannot  believe a judge would put our country in such peril. If something happens blame him and court system. People pouring in. Bad!  The judge opens up our country to potential terrorists and others that do not have our best interests at heart. Bad people are very happy!  Interview with @oreillyfactor on Fox Network - 4 Why aren't the lawyers looking at and using the Federal Court decision in Boston, which is at conflict with ridiculous lift ban decision?  Because the ban was lifted by a judge, many very bad and dangerous people may be pouring into our country. A terrible decision  What is our country coming to when a judge can halt a Homeland Security travel ban and anyone, even with bad intentions, can come into U.S.?  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!  After being forced to apologize for its bad and inaccurate coverage of me after winning the election, the FAKE NEWS @nytimes is still lost!  The opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned!  Interesting that certain Middle-Eastern countries agree with the ban. They know if certain people are allowed in it's death &amp; destruction!  When a country is no longer able to say who can, and who cannot , come in &amp; out, especially for reasons of safety &amp;.security - big trouble!

Thank you to Prime Minister of Australia for telling the truth about our very civil conversation that FAKE NEWS media lied about. Very nice!

Yes, Arnold Schwarzenegger did a really bad job as Governor of California and even worse on the Apprentice...but at least he tried hard!  Thank you, @Samsung! We would love to have you!  Iran was on its last legs and ready to collapse until the U.S. came along and gave it a life-line in the form of the Iran Deal Iran has been formally PUT ON NOTICE for firing a ballistic missile.Should have been thankful for the terrible deal the U.S. made with them!  Attending Chief Ryan Owens' Dignified Transfer yesterday with my daughter Ivanka was my great honor. To a great and brave man - thank you!  Congratulations to Rex Tillerson on being sworn in as our new Secretary of State. He will be a star!  If U.C. Berkeley does not allow free speech and practices violence on innocent people with a different point of view - NO FEDERAL FUNDS?  Do you believe it?

Great anger  Ratings for NFL football are way down except before game starts, when people tune in to see whether or not our country will be disrespected!  A few of the many clips of John McCain talking about Repealing &amp; Replacing O'Care. My oh my has he changed-complete‚Ä¶  ...owed to Wall Street and the banks which, sadly, must be dealt with.

RT @jayMAGA45 #StandForOurAnthem  The White House never looked more beautiful than it did returning last night. Important meetings taking place today. Big tax cuts &amp; reform.  The issue of kneeling has nothing to do with race. It is about respect for our Country, Flag and National Anthem. NFL must respect this!  Many people booed the players who kneeled yesterday (which was a small percentage of total). These are fans who demand respect for our Flag!  So proud of NASCAR and its supporters and fans. They won't put up with disrespecting our Country or our Flag - they said it loud and clear!  Making America Safe is my number one priority. We will not admit those into our country we cannot safely vet.
 2017-09-24 23 Sports fans should never condone players that do not stand proud for their National Anthem or their Country. NFL should change policy!

Great solidarity for our National Anthem and for our Country. Standing with locked arms is good, kneeling is not acceptable. Bad ratings!  ...NFL attendance and ratings are WAY DOWN. Boring games yes, but many stay away because they love our country. League should back U.S.  If NFL fans refuse to go to games until players stop disrespecting our Flag &amp; Country, you will see change take place fast. Fire or suspend!  Just heard Foreign Minister of North Korea speak at U.N. If he echoes thoughts of Little Rocket Man, they won't be around much longer!  Roger Goodell of NFL just put out a statement trying to justify the total disrespect certain players show to our country.Tell them to stand!  Democrats are laughingly saying that McCain had a "moment of courage." Tell that to the people of Arizona who were deceived. 116% increase!  Iran just test-fired a Ballistic Missile capable of reaching Israel.They are also working with North Korea.Not much of an agreement we have!  Very proud of our incredible First Lady (@FLOTUS.) She is a truly great representative for our country!  ...our Great American Flag (or Country) and should stand for the National Anthem. If not, YOU'RE FIRED. Find something else to do!  If a player wants the privilege of making millions of dollars in the NFL,or other leagues, he or she should not be allowed to disrespect....  Going to the White House is considered a great honor for a championship team.Stephen Curry is hesitating,therefore invitation is withdrawn!  It was great being with Luther Strange last night in Alabama. What great people, what a crowd! Vote Luther on Tuesday.  Alaska had a 200% plus increase in premiums under ObamaCare, worst in the country. Deductibles high, people angry! Lisa M comes through.  I know Rand Paul and I think he may find a way to get there for the good of the Party!  Large Block Grants to States is a good thing to do. Better control &amp;  management. Great for Arizona. McCain let his best friend L.G. down!  Arizona had a 116% increase in ObamaCare premiums last year, with deductibles very high. Chuck Schumer sold John McCain a bill of goods. Sad  John McCain never had any intention of voting for this Bill, which his Governor loves. He campaigned on Repeal &amp; Replace. Let Arizona down!  Heading to Alabama now, big crowd!

Problem is that the acting head of the FBI &amp; the person in charge of the Hillary investigation, Andrew McCabe, got $700,000 from H for wife!  Attorney General Jeff Sessions has taken a VERY weak position on Hillary Clinton crimes (where are E-mails &amp; DNC server) &amp; Intel leakers!  Ukrainian efforts to sabotage Trump campaign - "quietly working to boost Clinton." So where is the investigation A.G. @seanhannity  Is Fake News Washington Post being used as a lobbyist weapon against Congress to keep Politicians from looking into Amazon no-tax monopoly?  So many stories about me in the @washingtonpost are Fake News. They are as bad as ratings challenged @CNN. Lobbyist for Amazon and taxes?  The Amazon Washington Post fabricated the facts on my ending massive, dangerous, and wasteful payments to Syrian rebels fighting Assad.....  #2017Jambo- Remember your duty. Honor your history. Take care of the people God puts into your life ‚Äì and LOVE &amp; CH‚Ä¶  Any senator who votes against starting debate is telling America that you are fine w/ the #OCareNightmare! 
 2017-07-24 21 Arriving at Joint Base Andrews with @SecretaryPerry, @SecretaryZinke, and @SecPriceMD.....  Republicans have a last chance to do the right thing on Repeal &amp; Replace after years of talking &amp; campaigning on it.  Sleazy Adam Schiff, the totally biased Congressman looking into "Russia," spends all of his time on television pushing the Dem loss excuse!  So why aren't the Committees and investigators, and of course our beleaguered A.G., looking into Crooked Hillarys crimes &amp; Russia relations?  After 1 year of investigation with Zero evidence being found, Chuck Schumer just stated that "Democrats should blame ourselves,not Russia."  Drain the Swamp should be changed to Drain the Sewer - it's actually much worse than anyone ever thought, and it begins with the Fake News!  Thank you to @LOUDOBBS for giving the first six months of the Trump Administration an A+. S.C.,reg cutting,Stock M, jobs,border etc. = TRUE!  If Republicans don't Repeal and Replace the disastrous ObamaCare, the repercussions will be far greater than any of them understand!  It's hard to read the Failing New York Times or the Amazon Washington Post because every story/opinion, even if should be positive, is bad!  It's very sad that Republicans, even some that were carried over the line on my back, do very little to protect their President.  As the phony Russian Witch Hunt continues, two groups are laughing at this excuse for a lost election taking hold, Democrats and Russians!  To every PATRIOT who will serve on the #USSGeraldRFord 2017-07-23 00 American steel &amp; American hands have constructed a 100,000 ton message to the world A ship is only as good as the people who serve on it ‚Äî and the AMERICAN SAILOR is the BEST in the world. @USNavy‚Ä¶  Join me live for the commissioning ceremony of the USS Gerald R.

//t.co/PrVceEmPOB  ObamaCare is dead and the Democrats are obstructionists, no ideas or votes, only obstruction. It is solely up to the 52 Republican Senators!  The Republican Senators must step up to the plate and, after 7 years, vote to Repeal and Replace. Next, Tax Reform and Infrastructure. WIN!  In all fairness to Anthony Scaramucci, he wanted to endorse me 1st, before the Republican Primaries started, but didn't think I was running!  My son Donald openly gave his e-mails to the media &amp; authorities whereas Crooked Hillary Clinton deleted (&amp; acid washed) her 33,000 e-mails!  ...What about all of the Clinton ties to Russia, including Podesta Company, Uranium deal, Russian Reset, big dollar speeches etc.  So many people are asking why isn't the A.G. or Special Council looking at the many Hillary Clinton or Comey crimes. 33,000 e-mails deleted?  While all agree the U. S. President has the complete power to pardon, why think of that when only crime so far is LEAKS against us.FAKE NEWS  This morning I will be going to the Commissioning Ceremony for the largest aircraft carrier in the world, The Gerald R.

I will be having lunch at the White House today with Republican Senators concerning healthcare. They MUST keep their promise to America!  RT @FoxNews The Fake News is becoming more and more dishonest! Even a dinner arranged for top 20 leaders in Germany is made to look sinister!  Fake News story of secret dinner with Putin is "sick." All G 20 leaders, and spouses, were invited by the Chancellor of Germany. Press knew!  The Senate must go to a 51 vote majority instead of current 60 votes. Even parts of full Repeal need 60. 8 Dems control Senate. Crazy!  With only a very small majority, the Republicans in the House &amp; Senate need more victories next year since Dems totally obstruct, no votes!  As I have always said, let ObamaCare fail and then come together and do a great healthcare plan. Stay tuned!  We were let down by all of the Democrats and a few Republicans. Most Republicans were loyal, terrific &amp; worked really hard. We will return!  Republicans should just REPEAL failing ObamaCare now &amp; work on a new Healthcare Plan that will start from a clean slate. Dems will join in!  Most politicians would have gone to a meeting like the one Don jr attended in order to get info on an opponent. That's politics!  Heading back to Washington, D.C.

He didn't "choke," he colluded or obstructed, and it did the Dems and Crooked Hillary no good.  The reason that President Obama did NOTHING about Russia after being notified by the CIA of meddling is that he expected Clinton would win..  The Democrats have become nothing but OBSTRUCTIONISTS, they have no policies or ideas. All they do is delay and complain.They own ObamaCare!

Witch Hunt  Despite the phony Witch Hunt going on in America, the economic &amp; jobs numbers are great. Regulations way down, jobs and enthusiasm way up!  The Fake News Media hates when I use what has turned out to be my very powerful Social Media - over 100 million people! I can go around them  After 7 months of investigations &amp; committee hearings about my "collusion with the Russians,"  nobody has been able to show any proof.

Why is that Hillary Clintons family and Dems dealings with Russia are not looked at, but my non-dealings are?  You are witnessing the single greatest WITCH HUNT in American political history - led by some very bad and conflicted people!  #MAGA  They made up a phony collusion with the Russians story, found zero proof, so now they go for obstruction of justice on the phony story. Nice  Just left hospital. Rep. Steve Scalise, one of the truly great people, is in very tough shape - but he is a real fighter. Pray for Steve!  Happy birthday to U.S. ARMY and our soldiers. Thank you for your bravery, sacrifices, &amp; dedication. Proud to be your Commander-in-Chief!  Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana, a true friend and patriot, was badly injured but will fully recover.

In any event we are EXTREME VETTING people coming into the U.S. in order to help keep our country safe. The courts are slow and political!  The Justice Dept. should ask for an expedited hearing of the watered down Travel Ban before the Supreme Court - &amp; seek much tougher version!  The Justice Dept. should have stayed with the original Travel Ban, not the watered down, politically correct version they submitted to S.C.  People, the lawyers and the courts can call it whatever they want, but I am calling it what we need and what it is, a TRAVEL BAN!  Do you notice we are not having a gun debate right now? That's because they used knives and a truck!  At least 7 dead and 48 wounded in terror attack and Mayor of London says there is "no reason to be alarmed!"  We must stop being politically correct and get down to the business of security for our people. If we don't get smart it will only get worse  Whatever the United States can do to help out in London and the U. K., we will be there - WE ARE WITH YOU. GOD BLESS!

Hits Facebook &amp; even Dems &amp; DNC.  It was an honor to welcome the Prime Minister of Vietnam, Nguy·ªÖn Xu√¢n Ph√∫c to the @WhiteHouse this afternoon.

Enjoy!  RT @foxandfriends RT @Scavino45 The U.S. Senate should switch to 51 votes, immediately, and get Healthcare and TAX CUTS approved, fast and easy. Dems would do it, no doubt!  Russian officials must be laughing at the U.S. &amp; how a lame excuse for why the Dems lost the election has taken over the Fake News.

The massive TAX CUTS/REFORM that I have submitted is moving along in the process very well, actually ahead of schedule. Big benefits to all!  I suggest that we add more dollars to Healthcare and make it the best anywhere. ObamaCare is dead - the Republicans will do much better!  British Prime Minister May was very angry that the info the U.K. gave to U.S. about Manchester was leaked. Gave me full details!  Does anyone notice how the Montana Congressional race was such a big deal to Dems &amp; Fake News until the Republican won?

The DJT Foundation, unlike most foundations, never paid fees, rent, salaries or any expenses. 100% of money goes to wonderful charities!  I gave millions of dollars to DJT Foundation, raised or recieved millions more, ALL of which is given to charity, and media won't report!  The world was gloomy before I won - there was no hope. Now the market is up nearly 10% and Christmas spending is over a trillion dollars!  The United Nations has such great potential but right now it is just a club for people to get together, talk and have a good time. So sad!

Very impressive people!  I have not heard any of the pundits or commentators discussing the fact that I spent FAR LESS MONEY on the win than Hillary on the loss!  I would have done even better in the election, if that is possible, if the winner was based on popular vote - but would campaign differently  Campaigning to win the Electoral College is much more difficult &amp; sophisticated than the popular vote. Hillary focused on the wrong states!  Yes, it is true - Carlos Slim, the great businessman from Mexico, called me about getting together for a meeting. We met, HE IS A GREAT GUY!  especially how to get people, even with an unlimited budget, out to vote in the vital swing states ( and more).

 2016-10-12 14 Very little pick-up by the dishonest media of incredible information provided by WikiLeaks. So dishonest! Rigged system!  Crooked Hillary Clinton likes to talk about the things she will do but she has been there for 30 years - why didn't she do them?  Thank you Florida- a MOVEMENT that has never been seen before and will never be seen again. Lets get out &amp;‚Ä¶  Join me Thursday in Florida &amp; Ohio!

 2016-10-12 00 Wow, @CNN Town Hall questions were given to Crooked Hillary Clinton in advance of big debates against Bernie Sanders. Hillary &amp; CNN FRAUD!  Thank you Texas! If you haven't registered to VOTE- today is your last day. Go to VOTER REGISTRATION DEADLINES TODAY. You can register now at DON'T LET HER FOOL US AGAIN.

RT @DonaldJTrumpJr 2016-10-11 18 I hope people are looking at the disgraceful behavior of Hillary Clinton as exposed by WikiLeaks. She is unfit to run.  In Texas now, leaving soon for BIG rally in Florida!  The very foul mouthed Sen. John McCain begged for my support during his  primary (I gave, he won), then dropped me over locker room remarks!  Wow. Unbelievable.  Disloyal R's are far more difficult than Crooked Hillary. They come at you from all sides. They don‚Äôt know how to win - I will teach them!  With the exception of cheating Bernie out of the nom the Dems have always proven to be far more loyal to each other than the Republicans!  It is so nice that the shackles have been taken off me and I can now fight for America the way I want to.  RT @EricTrump//t.‚Ä¶  Our very weak and ineffective leader, Paul Ryan, had a bad conference call where his members went wild at his disloyalty.  Despite winning the second debate in a landslide (every poll), it is hard to do well when Paul Ryan and others give zero support!  Thank you Pennsylvania. This is a MOVEMENT like we have never seen before! #VoteTrumpPence16 on 11/8/16- together,‚Ä¶  Is this really America? Terrible!  Wow, @CNN got caught fixing their "focus group" in order to make Crooked Hillary look better. Really pathetic and totally dishonest!  Debate polls look great - thank you!
 2016-10-10 19 CNN is the worst - fortunately they have bad ratings because everyone knows they are biased.  Paul Ryan should spend more time on balancing the budget, jobs and illegal immigration and not waste his time on fighting Republican nominee  Thank you for all of the great comments on the debate last night.

Fake @NBCNews made up a story that I wanted a "tenfold" increase in our U.S. nuclear arsenal. Pure fiction, made up to demean. NBC = CNN!  It is about time that Roger Goodell of the NFL is finally demanding that all players STAND for our great National Anthem-RESPECT OUR COUNTRY  The Democrats want MASSIVE tax increases &amp; soft, crime producing borders.The Republicans want the biggest tax cut in history &amp; the WALL!  It would be really nice if the Fake News Media would report the virtually unprecedented Stock Market growth since the election.Need tax cuts  ...if Congress gives us the massive tax cuts (and reform) I am asking for, those numbers will grow by leaps and bounds. #MAGA  Stock Market has increased by 5.2 Trillion dollars since the election on November 8th, a 25% increase. Lowest unemployment in 16 years and..  ...fired. This story is totally made up by the dishonest media.The Chief is doing a FANTASTIC job for me and, more importantly, for the USA!  The Fake News is at it again, this time trying to hurt one of the finest people I know, General John Kelly, by saying he will soon be.....  My great honor to host the 2017 back-to-back #StanleyCup Champion Pittsburgh Penguins at the WH with @FLOTUS today!‚Ä¶  RT @IsraelUSAforevr The Failing @nytimes set Liddle' Bob Corker up by recording his conversation. Was made to sound a fool, and that's what I am dealing with!  Highly respected author, Christopher Bedford, just came out with book, "The Art of the Donald, Lessons from America's...." Really good book!  With Jemele Hill at the mike, it is no wonder ESPN ratings have "tanked," in fact, tanked so badly it is the talk of the industry!  Since Congress can't get its act together on HealthCare, I will be using the power of the pen to give great HealthCare to many people - FAST  The problem with agreeing to a policy on immigration is that the Democrats don't want secure borders,they don't care about safety for U.S.A.  Why is the NFL getting massive tax breaks while at the same time disrespecting our Anthem, Flag and Country? Change tax law!  RT @IvankaTrump A big salute to Jerry Jones, owner of the Dallas Cowboys, who will BENCH players who disrespect our Flag."Stand for Anthem or sit for game!"  "President Donald J. Trump Proclaims October 9, 2017, as #ColumbusDay"  The trip by @VP Pence was long planned. He is receiving great praise for leaving game after the players showed such disrespect for country!  Our country has been unsuccessfully dealing with North Korea for 25 years, giving billions of dollars &amp; getting nothing. Policy didn't work!  "The Republican Party is racking up record amounts of small dollar donations - fueled by Trump supporters....."   @nypost  Thank you!  Nobody could have done what I‚Äôve done for #PuertoRico with so little appreciation. So much work!  Bob Corker gave us the Iran Deal, &amp; that's about it. We need HealthCare, we need Tax Cuts/Reform, we need people that can get the job done!  RT @opinionsamerica FEMA and first responders are working hard (yet again) on Hurricane Nate. Military helping. Very much under control!  I asked @VP Pence to leave stadium if any players kneeled, disrespecting our country. I am proud of him and @SecondLady Karen.  ...Hence, I would fully expect Corker to be a negative voice and stand in the way of our great agenda. Didn't have the guts to run!  ..my endorsement). He also wanted to be Secretary of State, I said "NO THANKS." He is also largely responsible for the horrendous Iran Deal!  Senator Bob Corker "begged" me to endorse him for re-election in Tennessee.

Thanks for your support!  ...hasn't worked, agreements violated before the ink was dry, makings fools of U.S. negotiators. Sorry, but only one thing will work!  Presidents and their administrations have been talking to North Korea for 25 years, agreements made and massive amounts of money paid......  Will be joining @GovMikeHuckabee tonight at 8pmE on @TBN.

The good news is that the PEOPLE get it, which is really all that matters! Not #1  I called Chuck Schumer yesterday to see if the Dems want to do a great HealthCare Bill. ObamaCare is badly broken, big premiums. Who knows!  More and more people are suggesting that Republicans (and me) should be given Equal Time on T.V. when you look at the one-sided coverage?  Late Night host are dealing with the Democrats for their very "unfunny" &amp; repetitive material, always anti-Trump! Should we get Equal Time?  ...contributions. The RNC is taking in far more $'s than the Dems, and much of it by my wonderful small donors. I am working hard for them!  Can't believe I finally got a good story in the @washingtonpost. It discusses the enthusiasm of "Trump" voters through campaign....  RT @FoxBusiness RT @Scavino45 Ralph Northam,who is running for Governor of Virginia,is fighting for the violent MS-13 killer gangs &amp; sanctuary cities.  Vote Ed Gillespie!  Rex Tillerson never threatened to resign. This is Fake News put out by @NBCNews. Low news and reporting standards. No verification from me.  Stock Market hits an ALL-TIME high! Unemployment lowest in 16 years! Business and manufacturing enthusiasm at highest level in decades!  Why Isn't the Senate Intel Committee looking into the Fake News Networks in OUR country to see why so much of our news is just made up-FAKE!  Thank you!

No wonder their news ratings are way down!  Wow, so many Fake News stories today. No matter what I do or say, they will not write or speak truth. The Fake News Media is out of control!

The Governor of Puerto Rico, Ricardo Rossello, is a great guy and leader who is really working hard. Thank you Ricky!  Despite the Fake News Media in conjunction with the Dems, an amazing job is being done in Puerto Rico. Great people!  The Fake News Networks are working overtime in Puerto Rico doing their best to take the spirit away from our soldiers and first R's. Shame!  I will be going to Puerto Rico on Tuesday with Melania. Will hopefully be able to stop at the U.S. Virgin Islands (people working hard).  Fake News CNN and NBC are going out of their way to disparage our great First Responders as a way to "get Trump."

 2017-09-28 19 The electric power grid in Puerto Rico is totally shot. Large numbers of generators are now on Island. Food and water on site.  Democrats don't want massive tax cuts - how does that win elections? Great reviews for Tax Cut and Reform Bill.  It is time to take care of OUR people, to rebuild OUR NATION, and to fight for OUR GREAT AMERICAN WORKERS!‚Ä¶  This is the right TAX CUT @ the RIGHT TIME. We will ALL succeed &amp; grow TOGETHER ‚Äì as one team, one people, &amp; one Am‚Ä¶  Just arrived in Indianapolis, Indiana to make an announcement on #TaxReform!

Thank you to Carmen Yulin Cruz, the Mayor of San Juan, for your kind words on FEMA etc.We are working hard. Much food and water there/on way  Great interview on @foxandfriends with the parents of Otto Warmbier But while Dallas dropped to its knees as a team, they all stood up for our National Anthem. Big progress being made-we all love our country!  The booing at the NFL football game last night, when the entire Dallas team dropped to its knees, was loudest I have ever heard. Great anger  Ratings for NFL football are way down except before game starts, when people tune in to see whether or not our country will be disrespected!  A few of the many clips of John McCain talking about Repealing &amp; Replacing O'Care. My oh my has he changed-complete‚Ä¶  ...owed to Wall Street and the banks which, sadly, must be dealt with. Food, water and medical are top priorities - and doing well. #FEMA  ...It's old electrical grid, which was in terrible shape, was devastated. Much of the Island was destroyed, with billions of dollars....  Texas &amp; Florida are doing great but Puerto Rico, which was already suffering from broken infrastructure &amp; massive debt, is in deep trouble..  Tremendous backlash against the NFL and its players for disrespect of our Country.
29 General John Kelly totally agrees w/ my stance on NFL players and the fact that they should not be disrespecting our FLAG or GREAT COUNTRY!  .@CNN is #FakeNews. Just reported COS (John Kelly) was opposed to my stance on NFL players disrespecting FLAG, ANTHEM, COUNTRY. Total lie!  RT @jayMAGA45 #StandForOurAnthem  The White House never looked more beautiful than it did returning last night. Important meetings taking place today. Big tax cuts &amp; reform.  The issue of kneeling has nothing to do with race. It is about respect for our Country, Flag and National Anthem. NFL must respect this!  Many people booed the players who kneeled yesterday (which was a small percentage of total). These are fans who demand respect for our Flag!  So proud of NASCAR and its supporters and fans. They won't put up with disrespecting our Country or our Flag - they said it loud and clear!  Making America Safe is my number one priority. We will not admit those into our country we cannot safely vet.
 2017-09-24 23 Sports fans should never condone players that do not stand proud for their National Anthem or their Country. NFL should change policy!  Alaska, Arizona, Maine and Kentucky are big winners in the Healthcare proposal. 7 years of Repeal &amp; Replace and some Senators not there.  Courageous Patriots have fought and died for our great American Flag --- we MUST honor and respect it!  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!  RT @DonnaWR8 RT @DonnaWR8 2017-09-24 19 Please to inform that the Champion Pittsburgh Penguins of the NHL will be joining me at the White House for Ceremony. Great team!  Great solidarity for our National Anthem and for our Country. Standing with locked arms is good, kneeling is not acceptable. Bad ratings!  ...NFL attendance and ratings are WAY DOWN. Boring games yes, but many stay away because they love our country. League should back U.S.  If NFL fans refuse to go to games until players stop disrespecting our Flag &amp; Country, you will see change take place fast. Fire or suspend!  Just heard Foreign Minister of North Korea speak at U.N. If he echoes thoughts of Little Rocket Man, they won't be around much longer!  Roger Goodell of NFL just put out a statement trying to justify the total disrespect certain players show to our country.Tell them to stand!  Democrats are laughingly saying that McCain had a "moment of courage." Tell that to the people of Arizona who were deceived. 116% increase!  Iran just test-fired a Ballistic Missile capable of reaching Israel.They are also working with North Korea.Not much of an agreement we have!  Very proud of our incredible First Lady (@FLOTUS.) She is a truly great representative for our country!  ...our Great American Flag (or Country) and should stand for the National Anthem. If not, YOU'RE FIRED. Find something else to do!  If a player wants the privilege of making millions of dollars in the NFL,or other leagues, he or she should not be allowed to disrespect....  Going to the White House is considered a great honor for a championship team.Stephen Curry is hesitating,therefore invitation is withdrawn!  It was great being with Luther Strange last night in Alabama. What great people, what a crowd! Vote Luther on Tuesday.  Alaska had a 200% plus increase in premiums under ObamaCare, worst in the country. Deductibles high, people angry! Lisa M comes through.  I know Rand Paul and I think he may find a way to get there for the good of the Party!  Large Block Grants to States is a good thing to do. Better control &amp;  management. Great for Arizona. McCain let his best friend L.G. down!  Arizona had a 116% increase in ObamaCare premiums last year, with deductibles very high. Chuck Schumer sold John McCain a bill of goods. Sad  John McCain never had any intention of voting for this Bill, which his Governor loves. He campaigned on Repeal &amp; Replace. Let Arizona down!  Heading to Alabama now, big crowd!  Thank you to Doug Parker and American Airlines for all of the help you have given to the U.S. with Hurricane flights. Fantastic job!  #USAatUNGAüá∫üá∏#UNGA  Will be in Alabama tonight. Luther Strange has gained mightily since my endorsement, but will be very close. He loves Alabama, and so do I!  The greatest influence over our election was the Fake News Media "screaming" for Crooked Hillary Clinton. Next, she was a bad candidate!  The Russia hoax continues, now it's ads on Facebook. What about the totally biased and dishonest Media coverage in favor of Crooked Hillary?  RT @DonnaWR836 RT @TwitterData Thank you!  Kim Jong Un of North Korea, who is obviously a madman who doesn't mind starving or killing his people, will be tested like never before!  Rand Paul, or whoever votes against Hcare Bill, will forever (future political campaigns) be known as "the Republican who saved ObamaCare."  A big day for the U.S. at the United Nations!

13 Senator (Doctor) Bill Cassidy is a class act who really cares about people and their Health(care), he doesn't lie-just wants to help people!  The NRA strongly endorses Luther Strange for Senator of Alabama.That means all gun owners should vote for Big Luther. He won't let you down!  I would not sign Graham-Cassidy if it did not include coverage of pre-existing conditions. It does! A great Bill. Repeal &amp; Replace.  Alabama is sooo lucky to have a candidate like "Big" Luther Strange. Smart, tough on crime, borders &amp; trade, loves Vets &amp; Military. Tuesday!

South Korea is finding, as I have told them, that their talk of appeasement with North Korea will not work, they only understand one thing!  ..North Korea is a rogue nation which has become a great threat and embarrassment to China, which is trying to help but with little success.  North Korea has conducted a major Nuclear Test. Their words and actions continue to be very hostile and dangerous to the United States.....  So much SPIRIT in LA!

Even parts of full Repeal need 60. 8 Dems control Senate. Crazy!  With only a very small majority, the Republicans in the House &amp; Senate need more victories next year since Dems totally obstruct, no votes!  As I have always said, let ObamaCare fail and then come together and do a great healthcare plan. Stay tuned!  We were let down by all of the Democrats and a few Republicans. Most Republicans were loyal, terrific &amp; worked really hard. We will return!

The Justice Dept. should have stayed with the original Travel Ban, not the watered down, politically correct version they submitted to S.C.  People, the lawyers and the courts can call it whatever they want, but I am calling it what we need and what it is, a TRAVEL BAN!  Do you notice we are not having a gun debate right now?

I suggest that we add more dollars to Healthcare and make it the best anywhere. ObamaCare is dead - the Republicans will do much better!

FAKE NEWS media, which makes up stories and "sources," is far more effective than the discredited Democrats - but they are fading fast!  The spotlight has finally been put on the low-life leakers!

//t.co/bH60nBL5FP  Great listening session with CEO's of the Retail Industry Leaders Association this morning!  The real scandal here is that classified information is illegally given out by "intelligence" like candy. Very un-American!  Crimea was TAKEN by Russia during the Obama Administration. Was Obama too soft on Russia?  Thank you to Eli Lake of The Bloomberg View - "The NSA &amp; FBI...should not interfere in our politics...and is" Very serious situation for USA  Information is being illegally given to the failing @nytimes &amp; @washingtonpost by the intelligence community (NSA and FBI?).Just like Russia  This Russian connection non-sense is merely an attempt to cover-up the many mistakes made in Hillary Clinton's losing campaign.  The fake news media is going crazy with their conspiracy theories and blind hatred. @MSNBC &amp; @CNN are unwatchable. @foxandfriends is great!  Obamacare continues to fail. Humana to pull out in 2018. Will repeal, replace &amp; save healthcare for ALL Americans.

Some FAKE NEWS media, in order to marginalize, lies!  Any negative polls are fake news, just like the CNN, ABC, NBC polls in the election. Sorry, people want border security and extreme vetting.  What an amazing comeback and win by the Patriots. Tom Brady, Bob Kraft and Coach B are total winners. Wow!  Enjoy the #SuperBowl and then we continue I have instructed Homeland Security to check people coming into our country VERY CAREFULLY. The courts are making the job very difficult!  Just cannot  believe a judge would put our country in such peril. If something happens blame him and court system. People pouring in. Bad!

Interview with @oreillyfactor on Fox Network - 4 Why aren't the lawyers looking at and using the Federal Court decision in Boston, which is at conflict with ridiculous lift ban decision?  Because the ban was lifted by a judge, many very bad and dangerous people may be pouring into our country. A terrible decision  What is our country coming to when a judge can halt a Homeland Security travel ban and anyone, even with bad intentions, can come into U.S.?  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!  After being forced to apologize for its bad and inaccurate coverage of me after winning the election, the FAKE NEWS @nytimes is still lost!  The opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned!

Finally, in the new ABC News/Washington Post Poll, Hillary Clinton is down 11 points with WOMEN VOTERS and the election is close at 47-43!

 2016-10-16 19 The election is absolutely being rigged by the dishonest and distorted media pushing Crooked Hillary - but also at many polling places - SAD  We've all wondered how Hillary avoided prosecution for her email scheme. Wikileaks may have found the answer. Obama!  Hillary's staff thought her email scandal might just blow over. Who would trust these people with national security?  A country that Crooked Hillary says has funded ISIS also gave Wild Bill $1 million for his birthday? SO CORRUPT!  They let Crooked &amp; the Gang off the hook for the crime, but it looks like the cover-up is just as bad. Unbelievable!  Election is being rigged by the media, in a coordinated effort with the Clinton campaign, by putting stories that never happened into news!

Wow. Unbelievable.  Disloyal R's are far more difficult than Crooked Hillary. They come at you from all sides. They don‚Äôt know how to win - I will teach them!  With the exception of cheating Bernie out of the nom the Dems have always proven to be far more loyal to each other than the Republicans!  It is so nice that the shackles have been taken off me and I can now fight for America the way I want to.  RT @EricTrump//t.‚Ä¶  Our very weak and ineffective leader, Paul Ryan, had a bad conference call where his members went wild at his disloyalty.

 2016-10-10 19 CNN is the worst - fortunately they have bad ratings because everyone knows they are biased.
