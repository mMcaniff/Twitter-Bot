 I agree getting Tax Cuts approved  is important (we will also get HealthCare), but perhaps no Administration has done more in its first.....

 Crooked Hillary Clinton spent hundreds of millions of dollars more on Presidential Election than I did. Facebook was on her side, not mine!
 Keep hearing about "tiny" amount of money spent on Facebook ads. What about the billions of dollars of Fake News on CNN, ABC, NBC & CBS?
 Officials behind the now discredited "Dossier" plead the Fifth. Justice Department and/or FBI should immediately release who paid for it.

 Republicans are going for the big Budget approval today, first step toward massive tax cuts. I think we have the votes, but who knows?

 Democrat Congresswoman totally fabricated what I said to the wife of a soldier who died in action (and I have proof). Sad!
 The NFL has decided that it will not force players to stand for the playing of our National Anthem. Total disrespect for our great country!
 As it has turned out, James Comey lied and leaked and totally protected Hillary Clinton. He was the best thing that ever happened to her!
 The Democrats will only vote for Tax Increases. Hopefully, all Senate Republicans will vote for the largest Tax Cuts in U.S. history.

 ObamaCare is a broken mess. Piece by piece we will now begin the process of giving America the great HealthCare it deserves!
 Sadly, they and others are Fake News, and the public is just beginning to figure it out! 
The Democrats ObamaCare is imploding. Massive subsidy payments to their pet insurance companies has stopped. Dems should call me to fix!

 With all of the Fake News coming out of NBC and the Networks, at what point is it appropriate to challenge their License? Bad for country!
 Fake @NBCNews made up a story that I wanted a "tenfold" increase in our U.S. nuclear arsenal. Pure fiction, made up to demean. NBC = CNN!
 It is about time that Roger Goodell of the NFL is finally demanding that all players STAND for our great National Anthem-RESPECT OUR COUNTRY
 The Democrats want MASSIVE tax increases & soft, crime producing borders.The Republicans want the biggest tax cut in history & the WALL!
 It would be really nice if the Fake News Media would report the virtually unprecedented Stock Market growth since the election.Need tax cuts
 ...if Congress gives us the massive tax cuts (and reform) I am asking for, those numbers will grow by leaps and bounds. #MAGA

 Highly respected author, Christopher Bedford, just came out with book, "The Art of the Donald, Lessons from America's...." Really good book!
 With Jemele Hill at the mike, it is no wonder ESPN ratings have "tanked," in fact, tanked so badly it is the talk of the industry!
 Since Congress can't get its act together on HealthCare, I will be using the power of the pen to give great HealthCare to many people - FAST
 The problem with agreeing to a policy on immigration is that the Democrats don't want secure borders,they don't care about safety for U.S.A.
 Why is the NFL getting massive tax breaks while at the same time disrespecting our Anthem, Flag and Country? Change tax law!
 A big salute to Jerry Jones, owner of the Dallas Cowboys, who will BENCH players who disrespect our Flag."Stand for Anthem or sit for game!"
 "President Donald J. Trump Proclaims October 9, 2017, as #ColumbusDay" 
The trip by @VP Pence was long planned. He is receiving great praise for leaving game after the players showed such disrespect for country!
 Our country has been unsuccessfully dealing with North Korea for 25 years, giving billions of dollars & getting nothing. Policy didn't work!

 Nobody could have done what I‚Äôve done for #PuertoRico with so little appreciation. So much work!

 FEMA and first responders are working hard (yet again) on Hurricane Nate. Military helping. Very much under control!
 I asked @VP Pence to leave stadium if any players kneeled, disrespecting our country. I am proud of him and @SecondLady Karen.

 I called Chuck Schumer yesterday to see if the Dems want to do a great HealthCare Bill. ObamaCare is badly broken, big premiums. Who knows!
 More and more people are suggesting that Republicans (and me) should be given Equal Time on T.V. when you look at the one-sided coverage?

 Despite the Fake News Media in conjunction with the Dems, an amazing job is being done in Puerto Rico. Great people!
 The Fake News Networks are working overtime in Puerto Rico doing their best to take the spirit away from our soldiers and first R's. Shame!
 I will be going to Puerto Rico on Tuesday with Melania. Will hopefully be able to stop at the U.S. Virgin Islands (people working hard).
 Fake News CNN and NBC are going out of their way to disparage our great First Responders as a way to "get Trump." Not fair to FR or effort!

 Great interview on @foxandfriends with the parents of Otto Warmbier: 1994 - 2017. Otto was tortured beyond belief by North Korea.
 But while Dallas dropped to its knees as a team, they all stood up for our National Anthem. Big progress being made-we all love our country!
 The booing at the NFL football game last night, when the entire Dallas team dropped to its knees, was loudest I have ever heard. Great anger
 Ratings for NFL football are way down except before game starts, when people tune in to see whether or not our country will be disrespected!

 #StandForOurAnthem
 The White House never looked more beautiful than it did returning last night. Important meetings taking place today. Big tax cuts & reform.
 The issue of kneeling has nothing to do with race. It is about respect for our Country, Flag and National Anthem. NFL must respect this!
 Many people booed the players who kneeled yesterday (which was a small percentage of total). These are fans who demand respect for our Flag!
 So proud of NASCAR and its supporters and fans. They won't put up with disrespecting our Country or our Flag - they said it loud and clear!
 Making America Safe is my number one priority. We will not admit those into our country we cannot safely vet.
 
Sports fans should never condone players that do not stand proud for their National Anthem or their Country. NFL should change policy!
 Alaska, Arizona, Maine and Kentucky are big winners in the Healthcare proposal. 7 years of Repeal & Replace and some Senators not there.
 Courageous Patriots have fought and died for our great American Flag --- we MUST honor and respect it!  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
 Please to inform that the Champion Pittsburgh Penguins of the NHL will be joining me at the White House for Ceremony. Great team!
 Great solidarity for our National Anthem and for our Country. Standing with locked arms is good, kneeling is not acceptable. Bad ratings!
 ...NFL attendance and ratings are WAY DOWN. Boring games yes, but many stay away because they love our country. League should back U.S.
 If NFL fans refuse to go to games until players stop disrespecting our Flag & Country, you will see change take place fast. Fire or suspend!
 Just heard Foreign Minister of North Korea speak at U.N. If he echoes thoughts of Little Rocket Man, they won't be around much longer!
 Roger Goodell of NFL just put out a statement trying to justify the total disrespect certain players show to our country.Tell them to stand!
 Democrats are laughingly saying that McCain had a "moment of courage." Tell that to the people of Arizona who were deceived. 116% increase!
 Iran just test-fired a Ballistic Missile capable of reaching Israel.They are also working with North Korea.Not much of an agreement we have!
 Very proud of our incredible First Lady (@FLOTUS.) She is a truly great representative for our country!

 Going to the White House is considered a great honor for a championship team.Stephen Curry is hesitating,therefore invitation is withdrawn!
 It was great being with Luther Strange last night in Alabama. What great people, what a crowd! Vote Luther on Tuesday.
 Alaska had a 200% plus increase in premiums under ObamaCare, worst in the country. Deductibles high, people angry! Lisa M comes through.
 I know Rand Paul and I think he may find a way to get there for the good of the Party!
 Large Block Grants to States is a good thing to do. Better control &  management. Great for Arizona. McCain let his best friend L.G. down!
 Arizona had a 116% increase in ObamaCare premiums last year, with deductibles very high. Chuck Schumer sold John McCain a bill of goods. Sad
 John McCain never had any intention of voting for this Bill, which his Governor loves. He campaigned on Repeal & Replace. Let Arizona down!
 Heading to Alabama now, big crowd!
 Thank you to Doug Parker and American Airlines for all of the help you have given to the U.S. with Hurricane flights. Fantastic job!

 The greatest influence over our election was the Fake News Media "screaming" for Crooked Hillary Clinton. Next, she was a bad candidate!
 The Russia hoax continues, now it's ads on Facebook. What about the totally biased and dishonest Media coverage in favor of Crooked Hillary?
 Thank you! 
Kim Jong Un of North Korea, who is obviously a madman who doesn't mind starving or killing his people, will be tested like never before!
 Rand Paul, or whoever votes against Hcare Bill, will forever (future political campaigns) be known as "the Republican who saved ObamaCare."

 Senator (Doctor) Bill Cassidy is a class act who really cares about people and their Health(care), he doesn't lie-just wants to help people!
 The NRA strongly endorses Luther Strange for Senator of Alabama.That means all gun owners should vote for Big Luther. He won't let you down!
 I would not sign Graham-Cassidy if it did not include coverage of pre-existing conditions. It does! A great Bill. Repeal & Replace.
 Alabama is sooo lucky to have a candidate like "Big" Luther Strange. Smart, tough on crime, borders & trade, loves Vets & Military. Tuesday!

 How much longer will the failing nytimes, with its big losses and massive unfunded liability (and non-existent sources), remain in business?

 Just completed call with President Moon of South Korea. Very happy and impressed with 15-0 United Nations vote on North Korea sanctions.
 The Fake News refuses to report the success of the first 6 months: S.C., surging economy & jobs,border & military security,ISIS & MS-13 etc.
 MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 
United Nations Resolution is the single largest economic sanctions package ever on North Korea. Over one billion dollars in cost to N.K.
 Thank you Nicole! 
After many years of LEAKS going on in Washington, it is great to see the A.G. taking action! For National Security, the tougher the better!
 The United Nations Security Council just voted 15-0 to sanction North Korea. China and Russia voted with us. Very big financial impact!

 If ObamaCare is hurting people, & it is, why shouldn't it hurt the insurance companies & why should Congress not be paying what public pays?
 Don't give up Republican Senators, the World is watching: Repeal & Replace...and go to 51 votes (nuke option), get Cross State Lines & more.

 If the Senate Democrats ever got the chance, they would switch to a 51 majority vote in first minute. They are laughing at R's. MAKE CHANGE!
 ....8 Dems totally control the U.S. Senate. Many great Republican bills will never pass, like Kate's Law and complete Healthcare. Get smart!
 Republicans in the Senate will NEVER win if they don't go to a 51 vote majority NOW. They look like fools and are just wasting time......
 The very outdated filibuster rule must go. Budget reconciliation is killing R's in Senate. Mitch M, go to 51 Votes NOW and WIN. IT'S TIME!
 Republican Senate must get rid of 60 vote NOW! It is killing the R Party, allows 8 Dems to control country. 200 Bills sit in Senate. A JOKE!

 So why aren't the Committees and investigators, and of course our beleaguered A.G., looking into Crooked Hillarys crimes & Russia relations?
 After 1 year of investigation with Zero evidence being found, Chuck Schumer just stated that "Democrats should blame ourselves,not Russia."
 Drain the Swamp should be changed to Drain the Sewer - it's actually much worse than anyone ever thought, and it begins with the Fake News!

 If Republicans don't Repeal and Replace the disastrous ObamaCare, the repercussions will be far greater than any of them understand!
 It's hard to read the Failing New York Times or the Amazon Washington Post because every story/opinion, even if should be positive, is bad!
 It's very sad that Republicans, even some that were carried over the line on my back, do very little to protect their President.

 So many people are asking why isn't the A.G. or Special Council looking at the many Hillary Clinton or Comey crimes. 33,000 e-mails deleted?

The Republicans never discuss how good their healthcare bill is, & it will get even better at lunchtime.The Dems scream death as OCare dies!
 I will be having lunch at the White House today with Republican Senators concerning healthcare. They MUST keep their promise to America!
 The Fake News is becoming more and more dishonest! Even a dinner arranged for top 20 leaders in Germany is made to look sinister!
 Fake News story of secret dinner with Putin is "sick." All G 20 leaders, and spouses, were invited by the Chancellor of Germany. Press knew!
 The Senate must go to a 51 vote majority instead of current 60 votes. Even parts of full Repeal need 60. 8 Dems control Senate. Crazy!
 With only a very small majority, the Republicans in the House & Senate need more victories next year since Dems totally obstruct, no votes!
 As I have always said, let ObamaCare fail and then come together and do a great healthcare plan. Stay tuned!
 We were let down by all of the Democrats and a few Republicans. Most Republicans were loyal, terrific & worked really hard. We will return!
 Republicans should just REPEAL failing ObamaCare now & work on a new Healthcare Plan that will start from a clean slate. Dems will join in!
 Most politicians would have gone to a meeting like the one Don jr attended in order to get info on an opponent. That's politics!

The #AmazonWashingtonPost, sometimes referred to as the guardian of Amazon not paying internet taxes (which they should) is FAKE NEWS!
 Some of the Fake News Media likes to say that I am not totally engaged in healthcare. Wrong, I know the subject well & want victory for U.S.
 The failing @nytimes writes false story after false story about me. They don't even call to verify the facts of a story. A Fake News Joke!
 I just finished a great meeting with the Republican Senators concerning HealthCare. They really want to get it right, unlike OCare!
 With ZERO Democrats to help, and a failed, expensive and dangerous ObamaCare as the Dems legacy, the Republican Senators are working hard!
 So they caught Fake News CNN cold, but what about NBC, CBS & ABC? What about the failing @nytimes & @washingtonpost? They are all Fake News!
 Fake News CNN is looking at big management changes now that they got caught falsely pushing their phony Russian stories. Ratings way down!
 Wow, CNN had to retract big story on "Russia," with 3 employees forced to resign. What about all the other phony stories they do? FAKE NEWS!
 Great day for America's future Security and Safety, courtesy of the U.S. Supreme Court. I will keep fighting for the American people, & WIN!
 From @FoxNews "Bombshell: In 2016, Obama dismissed idea that anyone could rig an American election."  Check out his statement - Witch Hunt!
 Very grateful for the 9-O decision from the U. S. Supreme Court. We must keep America SAFE!
 Republican Senators are working very hard to get there, with no help from the Democrats. Not easy! Perhaps just let OCare crash & burn!
 ..under a magnifying glass, they have zero "tapes" of T people colluding. There is no collusion & no obstruction. I should be given apology!
 The real story is that President Obama did NOTHING after being informed in August about Russian meddling. With 4 months looking at Russia...
 ...and did not want to "rock the boat." He didn't "choke," he colluded or obstructed, and it did the Dems and Crooked Hillary no good.
 The reason that President Obama did NOTHING about Russia after being notified by the CIA of meddling is that he expected Clinton would win..
 The Democrats have become nothing but OBSTRUCTIONISTS, they have no policies or ideas. All they do is delay and complain.They own ObamaCare!
 Hillary Clinton colluded with the Democratic Party in order to beat Crazy Bernie Sanders. Is she allowed to so collude? Unfair to Bernie!
 MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
 I cannot imagine that these very fine Republican Senators would allow the American people to suffer a broken ObamaCare any longer!
 Obama Administration official said they "choked" when it came to acting on Russian meddling of election. They didn't want to hurt Hillary?
 Since the Obama Administration was told way before the 2016 Election that the Russians were meddling, why no action? Focus on them, not T!
 Democrats slam GOP healthcare proposal as Obamacare premiums & deductibles increase by over 100%. Remember keep your doctor, keep your plan?
 Just out: The Obama Administration knew far in advance of November 8th about election meddling by Russia. Did nothing about it. WHY?

...whether there are "tapes" or recordings of my conversations with James Comey, but I did not make, and do not have, any such recordings.
 With all of the recently reported electronic surveillance, intercepts, unmasking and illegal leaking of information, I have no idea...
 I certainly hope the Democrats do not force Nancy P out. That would be very bad for the Republican Party - and please let Cryin' Chuck stay!
 ...Why did the DNC REFUSE to turn over its Server to the FBI, and still hasn't? It's all a big Dem scam and excuse for losing the election!
 ...Why did Democratic National Committee turn down the DHS offer to protect against hacks (long prior to election). It's all a big Dem HOAX!
 By the way, if Russia was working so hard on the 2016 Election, it all took place during the Obama Admin. Why didn't they stop them?
 Former Homeland Security Advisor Jeh Johnson is latest top intelligence official to state there was no grand scheme between Trump & Russia.

I am being investigated for firing the FBI Director by the man who told me to fire the FBI Director! Witch Hunt
 Despite the phony Witch Hunt going on in America, the economic & jobs numbers are great. Regulations way down, jobs and enthusiasm way up!
 The Fake News Media hates when I use what has turned out to be my very powerful Social Media - over 100 million people! I can go around them
 After 7 months of investigations & committee hearings about my "collusion with the Russians,"  nobody has been able to show any proof. Sad!

 Remarks‚Ä¶ 
Crooked H destroyed phones w/ hammer, 'bleached' emails, & had husband meet w/AG days before she was cleared- & they talk about obstruction?
 Why is that Hillary Clintons family and Dems dealings with Russia are not looked at, but my non-dealings are?
 You are witnessing the single greatest WITCH HUNT in American political history - led by some very bad and conflicted people!  #MAGA
 They made up a phony collusion with the Russians story, found zero proof, so now they go for obstruction of justice on the phony story. Nice
 Just left hospital. Rep. Steve Scalise, one of the truly great people, is in very tough shape - but he is a real fighter. Pray for Steve!
 Happy birthday to U.S. ARMY and our soldiers. Thank you for your bravery, sacrifices, & dedication. Proud to be your Commander-in-Chief!

 Fake News is at an all time high. Where is their apology to me for all of the incorrect stories???
 A.G. Lynch made law enforcement decisions for political purposes...gave Hillary Clinton a free pass and protection. Totally illegal!
 Well, as predicted, the 9th Circuit did it again - Ruled against the TRAVEL BAN at such a dangerous time in the history of our country. S.C.

 During my recent trip to the Middle East I stated that there can no longer be funding of Radical Ideology. Leaders pointed to Qatar - look!
 The FAKE MSM is working so hard trying to get me not to use Social Media. They hate that I can get the honest and unfiltered message out.
 Big meeting today with Republican leadership concerning Tax Cuts and Healthcare. We are all pushing hard - must get it right!
 That's right, we need a TRAVEL BAN for certain DANGEROUS countries, not some politically correct term that won't help us protect our people!
 Today, I announced an Air Traffic Control Initiative to take American air travel into the future - finally!

 In any event we are EXTREME VETTING people coming into the U.S. in order to help keep our country safe. The courts are slow and political!
 The Justice Dept. should ask for an expedited hearing of the watered down Travel Ban before the Supreme Court - & seek much tougher version!
 The Justice Dept. should have stayed with the original Travel Ban, not the watered down, politically correct version they submitted to S.C.
 People, the lawyers and the courts can call it whatever they want, but I am calling it what we need and what it is, a TRAVEL BAN!
 Do you notice we are not having a gun debate right now? That's because they used knives and a truck!
 At least 7 dead and 48 wounded in terror attack and Mayor of London says there is "no reason to be alarmed!"
 We must stop being politically correct and get down to the business of security for our people. If we don't get smart it will only get worse
 Whatever the United States can do to help out in London and the U. K., we will be there - WE ARE WITH YOU. GOD BLESS!
 We need to be smart, vigilant and tough. We need the courts to give us back our rights. We need the Travel Ban as an extra level of safety!

 The U.S. Senate should switch to 51 votes, immediately, and get Healthcare and TAX CUTS approved, fast and easy. Dems would do it, no doubt!
 Russian officials must be laughing at the U.S. & how a lame excuse for why the Dems lost the election has taken over the Fake News.
 We have a MASSIVE trade deficit with Germany, plus they pay FAR LESS than they should on NATO & military. Very bad for U.S. This will change

 The Fake News Media works hard at disparaging & demeaning my use of social media because they don't want America to hear the real story!
 The massive TAX CUTS/REFORM that I have submitted is moving along in the process very well, actually ahead of schedule. Big benefits to all!
 I suggest that we add more dollars to Healthcare and make it the best anywhere. ObamaCare is dead - the Republicans will do much better!
 British Prime Minister May was very angry that the info the U.K. gave to U.S. about Manchester was leaked. Gave me full details!

 Sally Yates made the fake media extremely unhappy today --- she said nothing but old news!
 Director Clapper reiterated what everybody, including the fake media already knows- there is "no evidence" of collusion w/ Russia and Trump.

 Is it legal for a sitting President to be "wire tapping" a race for president prior to an election? Turned down by court earlier. A NEW LOW!
 Just out: The same Russian Ambassador that met Jeff Sessions visited the Obama White House 22 times, and 4 times last year alone.
 Terrible! Just found out that Obama had my "wires tapped" in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism!
 The first meeting Jeff Sessions had with the Russian Amb was set up by the Obama Administration under education program for 100 Ambs......
 MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 
I hereby demand a second investigation, after Schumer, of Pelosi for her close ties to Russia, and lying about it. 
We must fix our education system for our kids to Make America Great Again. Wonderful day at Saint Andrew in Orlando. 
We should start an immediate investigation into @SenSchumer and his ties to Russia and Putin. A total hypocrite!

Great meeting with CEOs of leading U.S. health insurance companies who provide great healthcare to the American peo‚Ä¶ 
Big dinner with Governors tonight at White House. Much to be discussed, including healthcare.
 Russia talk is FAKE NEWS put out by the Dems, and played up by the media, in order to mask the big election defeat and the illegal leaks!
 For first time the failing @nytimes will take an ad (a bad one) to help save its failing reputation. Try reporting accurately & fairly!
 The race for DNC Chairman was, of course, totally "rigged." Bernie's guy, like Bernie himself, never had a chance. Clinton demanded Perez!
 Congratulations to Thomas Perez, who has just been named Chairman of the DNC. I could not be happier for him, or for the Republican Party!
 I will not be attending the White House Correspondents' Association Dinner this year. Please wish everyone well and have a great evening!
 Weekly Address from @WhiteHouse: 
Great optimism for future of U.S. business, AND JOBS, with the DOW having an 11th straight record close. Big tax & regulation cuts coming!
 The media has not reported that the National Debt in my first month went down by $12 billion vs a $200 billion increase in Obama first mo.
 Maybe the millions of people who voted to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN should have their own rally. It would be the biggest of them all!
 FAKE NEWS media knowingly doesn't tell the truth. A great danger to our country. The failing @nytimes has become a joke. Likewise @CNN. Sad!

 One thing I will say about Rep. Keith Ellison, in his fight to lead the DNC, is that he was the one who predicted early that I would win!
 The so-called angry crowds in home districts of some Republicans are actually, in numerous cases, planned out by liberal activists. Sad!

Just named General H.R. McMaster National Security Advisor.
 HAPPY PRESIDENTS DAY - MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
 Give the public a break - The FAKE NEWS media is trying to say that large scale immigration in Sweden is working out just beautifully. NOT!
 My statement as to what's happening in Sweden was in reference to a story that was broadcast on @FoxNews concerning immigrants & Sweden.
 Will be having many meetings this weekend at The Southern White House. Big 5:00 P.M. speech in Melbourne, Florida. A lot to talk about!
 Don't believe the main stream (fake news) media.The White House is running VERY WELL. I inherited a MESS and am in the process of fixing it.
 Looking forward to the Florida rally tomorrow. Big crowd expected!
 "One of the most effective press conferences I've ever seen!" says Rush Limbaugh. Many agree.Yet FAKE MEDIA  calls it differently! Dishonest
 The FAKE NEWS media (failing @nytimes, @NBCNews, @ABC, @CBS, @CNN) is not my enemy, it is the enemy of the American People!
 Join me at 11:00am:
 Watch here: 
General Keith Kellogg, who I have known for a long time, is very much in play for NSA - as are three others.
 Thank you for all of the nice statements on the Press Conference yesterday. Rush Limbaugh said one of greatest ever. Fake media not happy!
 Going to Charleston, South Carolina, in order to spend time with Boeing and talk jobs! Look forward to it.
 Despite the long delays by the Democrats in finally approving Dr. Tom Price, the repeal and replacement of ObamaCare is moving fast!
 'Trump signs bill undoing Obama coal mining rule' 
The Democrats had to come up with a story as to why they lost the election, and so badly (306), so they made up a story - RUSSIA. Fake news!
 FAKE NEWS media, which makes up stories and "sources," is far more effective than the discredited Democrats - but they are fading fast!
 The spotlight has finally been put on the low-life leakers! They will be caught!
 Leaking, and even illegal classified leaking, has been a big problem in Washington for years. Failing @nytimes (and others) must apologize!
 Stock market hits new high with longest winning streak in decades. Great level of confidence and optimism - even before tax plan rollout!

Great listening session with CEO's of the Retail Industry Leaders Association this morning! 
The real scandal here is that classified information is illegally given out by "intelligence" like candy. Very un-American!
 Crimea was TAKEN by Russia during the Obama Administration. Was Obama too soft on Russia?
 Thank you to Eli Lake of The Bloomberg View - "The NSA & FBI...should not interfere in our politics...and is" Very serious situation for USA
 Information is being illegally given to the failing @nytimes & @washingtonpost by the intelligence community (NSA and FBI?).Just like Russia
 This Russian connection non-sense is merely an attempt to cover-up the many mistakes made in Hillary Clinton's losing campaign.
 The fake news media is going crazy with their conspiracy theories and blind hatred. @MSNBC & @CNN are unwatchable. @foxandfriends is great!
 Obamacare continues to fail. Humana to pull out in 2018. Will repeal, replace & save healthcare for ALL Americans.

 After two days of very productive talks, Prime Minister Abe is heading back to Japan. L

A working dinner tonight with Prime Minister Abe of Japan, and his representatives, at the Winter White House (Mar-a-Lago). Very good talks!
 Played golf today with Prime Minister Abe of Japan and @TheBig_Easy, Ernie Els, and had a great time. Japan is very well represented!

 Sen. McCain should not be talking about the success or failure of a mission to the media. Only emboldens the enemy! He's been losing so....
 Chris Cuomo, in his interview with Sen. Blumenthal, never asked him about his long-term lie about his brave "service" in Vietnam. FAKE NEWS!
 Sen.Richard Blumenthal, who never fought in Vietnam when he said for years he had (major lie),now misrepresents what Judge Gorsuch told him?

 If the U.S. does not win this case as it so obviously should, we can never have the security and safety to which we are entitled. Politics!
 It is a disgrace that my full Cabinet is still not in place, the longest such delay in the history of our country. Obstruction by Democrats!

I don't know Putin, have no deals in Russia, and the haters are going crazy - yet Obama can make a deal with Iran, #1 in terror, no problem!
 The threat from radical Islamic terrorism is very real, just look at what is happening in Europe and the Middle-East. Courts must act fast!
 The failing @nytimes was forced to apologize to its subscribers for the poor reporting it did on my election win. Now they are worse!
 An extended interview from the Super Bowl with @oreillyfactor airs tonight at 8:00 P.M. Enjoy! 
The failing @nytimes writes total fiction concerning me. They have gotten it wrong for two years, and now are making up stories & sources!
 I call my own shots, largely based on an accumulation of data, and everyone knows it. Some FAKE NEWS media, in order to marginalize, lies!
 Any negative polls are fake news, just like the CNN, ABC, NBC polls in the election. Sorry, people want border security and extreme vetting.
 What an amazing comeback and win by the Patriots. Tom Brady, Bob Kraft and Coach B are total winners. Wow!
 Enjoy the #SuperBowl and then we continue: MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
 I have instructed Homeland Security to check people coming into our country VERY CAREFULLY. The courts are making the job very difficult!
 Just cannot  believe a judge would put our country in such peril. If something happens blame him and court system. People pouring in. Bad!
 The judge opens up our country to potential terrorists and others that do not have our best interests at heart. Bad people are very happy!
 Interview with @oreillyfactor on Fox Network - 4:00 P.M. (prior to Super Bowl). Enjoy!
 Why aren't the lawyers looking at and using the Federal Court decision in Boston, which is at conflict with ridiculous lift ban decision?
 Because the ban was lifted by a judge, many very bad and dangerous people may be pouring into our country. A terrible decision
 What is our country coming to when a judge can halt a Homeland Security travel ban and anyone, even with bad intentions, can come into U.S.?
 MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
 After being forced to apologize for its bad and inaccurate coverage of me after winning the election, the FAKE NEWS @nytimes is still lost!
 The opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned!
 Interesting that certain Middle-Eastern countries agree with the ban. They know if certain people are allowed in it's death & destruction!
 When a country is no longer able to say who can, and who cannot , come in & out, especially for reasons of safety &.security - big trouble!
 Countries charge U.S. companies taxes or tariffs while the U.S. charges them nothing or little.We should charge them SAME as they charge us!
 We must keep "evil" out of our country!
 A new radical Islamic terrorist has just attacked in Louvre Museum in Paris. Tourists were locked down. France on edge again. GET SMART U.S.
 Professional anarchists, thugs and paid protesters are proving the point of the millions of people who voted to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

 Thank you to Prime Minister of Australia for telling the truth about our very civil conversation that FAKE NEWS media lied about. Very nice!
 Iran is playing with fire - they don't appreciate how "kind" President Obama was to them. Not me!
 Yes, Arnold Schwarzenegger did a really bad job as Governor of California and even worse on the Apprentice...but at least he tried hard!
 Thank you, @Samsung! We would love to have you! 
Iran was on its last legs and ready to collapse until the U.S. came along and gave it a life-line in the form of the Iran Deal: $150 billion
 Iran has been formally PUT ON NOTICE for firing a ballistic missile.Should have been thankful for the terrible deal the U.S. made with them!
 Attending Chief Ryan Owens' Dignified Transfer yesterday with my daughter Ivanka was my great honor. To a great and brave man - thank you!
 Congratulations to Rex Tillerson on being sworn in as our new Secretary of State. He will be a star!
 If U.C. Berkeley does not allow free speech and practices violence on innocent people with a different point of view - NO FEDERAL FUNDS?
 Do you believe it? The Obama Administration agreed to take thousands of illegal immigrants from Australia. Why? I will study this dumb deal!
 Iran is rapidly taking over more and more of Iraq even after the U.S. has squandered three trillion dollars there. Obvious long ago!
 Everybody is arguing whether or not it is a BAN. Call it what you want, it is about keeping bad people (with bad intentions) out of country!
 Hope you like my nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch for the United States Supreme Court. He is a good and brilliant man, respected by all.

 We had a great News Conference at Trump Tower today. A couple of FAKE NEWS organizations were there but the people truly get what's going on
 Intelligence agencies should never have allowed this fake news to "leak" into the public. One last shot at me.Are we living in Nazi Germany?
 I win an election easily, a great "movement" is verified, and crooked opponents try to belittle our victory with FAKE NEWS. A sorry state!
 Russia has never tried to use leverage over me. I HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH RUSSIA - NO DEALS, NO LOANS, NO NOTHING!
 Russia just said the unverified report paid for by political opponents is "A COMPLETE AND TOTAL FABRICATION, UTTER NONSENSE." Very unfair!

 I watched parts of @nbcsnl Saturday Night Live last night. It is a totally one-sided, biased show - nothing funny at all. Equal time for us?
 Numerous patriots will be coming to Bedminster today as I continue to fill out the various positions necessary to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
 The cast and producers of Hamilton, which I hear is highly overrated, should immediately apologize to Mike Pence for their terrible behavior
 The Theater must always be a safe and special place.The cast of Hamilton was very rude last night to a very good man, Mike Pence. Apologize!
 Our wonderful future V.P. Mike Pence was harassed last night at the theater by the cast of Hamilton, cameras blazing.This should not happen!
 The ONLY bad thing about winning the Presidency is that I did not have the time to go through a long but winning trial on Trump U. Too bad!
 I settled the Trump University lawsuit for a small fraction of the potential award because as President I have to focus on our country.
 Will be working all weekend in choosing the great men and women who will be helping to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
 I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!

 My transition team, which is working long hours and doing a fantastic job, will be seeing many great candidates today. #MAGA
 Australia, New Zealand, and more. I am always available to them. @nytimes is just upset that they looked like fools in their coverage of me.
 I have recieved and taken calls from many foreign leaders despite what the failing @nytimes said. Russia, U.K., China, Saudi Arabia, Japan,
 The failing @nytimes story is so totally wrong on transition. It is going so smoothly. Also, I have spoken to many foreign leaders.
 I am not trying to get "top level security clearance" for my children. This was a typically false news story.
 Very organized process taking place as I decide on Cabinet and many other positions. I am the only one who knows who the finalists are!
 The Electoral College is actually genius in that it brings all states, including the smaller ones, into play. Campaigning is much different!
 If the election were based on total popular vote I would have campaigned in  N.Y. Florida and California and won even bigger and more easily
 The debates, especially the second and third, plus speeches and intensity of the large rallies, plus OUR GREAT SUPPORTERS, gave us the win!
 I will be interviewed on @60Minutes tonight after the NFL game - 7:00 P.M. Enjoy!
 The @nytimes states today that DJT believes "more countries should acquire nuclear weapons." How dishonest are they. I never said this!
 Governor John Kasich of the GREAT, GREAT, GREAT State of Ohio called to congratulate me on the win. The people of Ohio were incredible!
 Jeb Bush, George W and George H.W. all called to express their best wishes on the win. Very nice!
 Mitt Romney called to congratulate me on the win. Very nice!
 The @nytimes sent a letter to their subscribers apologizing for their BAD coverage of me. I wonder if it will change - doubt it?
 Wow, the @nytimes is losing thousands of subscribers because of their very poor and highly inaccurate coverage of the "Trump phenomena"
 This will prove to be a great time in the lives of ALL Americans. We will unite and we will win, win, win!
 Today we express our deepest gratitude to all those who have served in our armed forces. #ThankAVet 
Busy day planned in New York. Will soon be making some very important decisions on the people who will be running our government!
 Love the fact that the small groups of protesters last night have passion for our great country. We will all come together and be proud!
 Just had a very open and successful presidential election. Now professional protesters, incited by the media, are protesting. Very unfair!
 A fantastic day in D.C. Met with President Obama for first time. Really good meeting, great chemistry. Melania liked Mrs. O a lot!

 "Journalists shower Hillary Clinton with campaign cash"
 
"State Department official accused of offering 'quid pro quo' in Clinton email scandal" 
Wow, new polls just came out from @CNN   Great numbers, especially after total media hit job. Leading Ohio 48 - 44.
 Voter fraud! Crooked Hillary Clinton even got the questions to a debate, and nobody says a word. Can you imagine if I got the questions?
 Unbelievable. 
WikiLeaks proves even the Clinton campaign knew Crooked mishandled classified info, but no one gets charged? RIGGED! 
We have all got to come together and win this election. We can't have four more years of Obama (or worse!).
 Of course there is large scale voter fraud happening on and before election day. Why do Republican leaders deny what is going on? So naive!

The election is absolutely being rigged by the dishonest and distorted media pushing Crooked Hillary - but also at many polling places - SAD
 We've all wondered how Hillary avoided prosecution for her email scheme. Wikileaks may have found the answer. Obama! 
Hillary's staff thought her email scandal might just blow over. Who would trust these people with national security? 
A country that Crooked Hillary says has funded ISIS also gave Wild Bill $1 million for his birthday? SO CORRUPT! 
They let Crooked & the Gang off the hook for the crime, but it looks like the cover-up is just as bad. Unbelievable! 
Election is being rigged by the media, in a coordinated effort with the Clinton campaign, by putting stories that never happened into news!
 Polls close, but can you believe I lost large numbers of women voters based on made up events THAT NEVER HAPPENED. Media rigging election!

 It is so nice that the shackles have been taken off me and I can now fight for America the way I want to.
 Our very weak and ineffective leader, Paul Ryan, had a bad conference call where his members went wild at his disloyalty.

 Melania and I extend our warmest greetings to those observing Rosh Hashanah here in the United States, in Israel, and around the world.
 Bernie should pull his endorsement of Crooked Hillary after she decieved him and then attacked him and his supporters.
 "@trumplican2016: .@realDonaldTrump  There will be MASSIVE turnout for you,  Mr. Trump - These polls don't register the pulse of the PEOPLE!
 I have created tens of thousands of jobs and will bring back great American prosperity. Hillary has only created jobs at the FBI and DOJ!
 I know our complex tax laws better than anyone who has ever run for president and am the only one who can fix them. #failing@nytimes
 Heading to Pennsylvania for a big rally tonight. We will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
 Wow, just saw the really bad @CNN ratings. People don't want to watch bad product that only builds up Crooked Hillary.
 The so-called Commission on Presidential Debates admitted to us that the DJT audio & sound level was very bad. So why didn't they fix it?
 I won the debate if you decide without watching the totally one-sided "spin" that followed. This despite the really bad microphone.
 Crooked H is nasty to Sanders supporters behind closed doors. Owned by Wall St and Politicians, HRC is not with you.

The people are really smart in cancelling subscriptions to the Dallas & Arizona papers & now USA Today will lose readers! The people get it!
 Remember, don't believe "sources said" by the VERY dishonest media. If they don't name the sources, the sources don't exist.
 Did Crooked Hillary help disgusting (check out sex tape and past) Alicia M become a U.S. citizen so she could use her in the debate?
 Using Alicia M in the debate as a paragon of virtue just shows that Crooked Hillary suffers from BAD JUDGEMENT! Hillary was set up by a con.
 Wow, Crooked Hillary was duped and used by my worst Miss U. Hillary floated her as an "angel" without checking her past, which is terrible!
 Anytime you see a story about me or my campaign saying "sources said," DO NOT believe it. There are no sources, they are just made up lies!
 Wow, did you see how badly @CNN (Clinton News Network) is doing in the ratings. With people like @donlemon, who could expect any more?
 While Hillary profits off the rigged system, I am fighting for you! Remember the simple phrase: #FollowTheMoney‚Ä¶
